This plugin package includes helpful features to get you on your way to create your game in RPG Maker MZ.

# How to build

`yarn` is a new package manager. To build this plugin directly, You should install `yarn` or `npm` first after installing `Node.js`. I recommand a package manager called 'yarn' because it is more stable and easy to use.

```sh
brew install node
brew install yarn
```

To build this plugin, you need to run the following command:
